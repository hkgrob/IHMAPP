They willincrease expectancy of God’s goodness, and thuswill increase the manifestation of that goodness inyour life. Jesus said, “According to your faith, so beit” (Matthew 8:13). Say these (and otherdeclarations) every day for a month and see whathappens to your life.1. My prayers are powerful and effective (James5:16b).2. God richly supplies all my needs (Philippians4:19).3. I am dead to sin and alive to live supernaturally(Romans 6:11; 2 Peter 1:4).4. I walk in ever-increasing health (Psalm 103:1-3,Isaiah 53:5).5. I live under supernatural protection (Psalm 91).6. Like Jesus, I prosper in all my relationships (Luke2:52).7. I consistently bring God encounters to otherpeople (Mark 16:17-18 NKJV).8. Through Jesus, I am 100% loved and worthy toreceive all of God’s blessings (Colossians 1:12-14).9. Each of my family members is wonderfullyblessed and radically loves Jesus (Acts 16:30-31).10. I uproariously laugh when I hear a lie from thedevil (Psalm 2:2-4).Declarations #2 – Remember this: Faith is theevidence of things not seen (Hebrews 11:1). Our“evidence” for things being true is not ourcircumstances, but God’s promises. We don’t denynegative facts in our lives, but we choose to focuson a higher reality: God’s truth. Faith indeed comesby hearing (Romans 10:17); therefore, we choose tospeak these powerful truths to build our own faith.1. I set the course of my life with my words (James3:2-5).2. God is on my side; therefore, I cannot bediscouraged or defeated (Romans 8:37; Psalm 91;Philippians 4:13).3. I am the head, not the tail. I have insight. I havewisdom. I have ideas and divine strategies. I haveauthority (Deuteronomy 8:18; 28:13; James 1:5-8;Luke 10:19).4. As Abraham did, I speak God’s promises over mylife. My faith is being strengthened to possess allthat Jesus won for me (Romans 4:17-23).5. I have a sound mind. Today, I will think the rightthoughts, say the right words, and make the rightdecisions in every situation I face (2 Timothy 1:7).6. I expect to have powerful, divine appointmentstoday to heal the sick, raise the dead, prophesy life,lead people to Christ, bring deliverance, releasesigns and wonders, and bless every place I go(Book of Acts).7. I expect that today will be the best day of my lifespiritually, emotionally, relationally, and financially inJesus’ name. (Romans 15:13).Declarations #3 – One of the main methods Jesusand the apostles used in the gospels and Acts wasto SPEAK TO things. You will notice that they did notask God to heal people, cast out demons, or raisethe dead, but they spoke to bodies, demons, thewind, etc. Jesus encouraged us to speak tomountains (Mark 11:23). This set of declarationsspecifically focuses on speaking to various aspectsof our lives.1. My angels are carrying out the Word of God onmy behalf (Psalm 103:20).2. All attacks that are headed my way are divertedby angelic protection in Jesus’ name (Psalm 91).3. I declare peace over the raging waters in mymind, emotions, body, and family. I say, “Peace, bestill” to each of these areas of my life (Mark 4:39).4. I speak to every mountain of discouragement,stress, depression, and lack, and cast it into the seain Jesus’ name (Mark 11:22-24).5. I speak to this day, and I call you blessed. Ideclare I serve a mighty God who today will doexceedingly and abundantly beyond all that I canask or think (Ephesians 3:20). I say You are a goodGod and I eagerly anticipate Your goodness today.Courtesy of Igniting Hope MinistriesSteve & Wendy Backlund
